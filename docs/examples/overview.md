There is a `Ask!` project [template](https://github.com/ask-lang/ask-template), run the command below:

```bash
yarn build flipper.ts
```

As a result you'll get a file `build/flipper.wasm` file and a `metadata.json` file in the `build/` folder of your contract.

In our [examples folder](https://github.com/ask-lang/ask/tree/main/examples) you can find a number of examples written in `Ask!`.

For further information, please have a look at the [Deploy your Contract](../getting-started/deploying.md) section.
