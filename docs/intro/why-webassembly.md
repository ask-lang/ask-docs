* <span class="highlight">High performance: </span>Wasm is high performance — it’s built to be as close to native machine code as possible while still being platform independent.

* <span class="highlight">Small size: </span>It facilitates small binaries to ship over the internet to devices with potentially slow internet connection.
This is a great fit for the space-constrainted blockchain world.

* <span class="highlight">General VM & bytecode: </span>
It was developed so that code can be deployed in any browser with the same result.
Contrary to the EVM it was not developed towards a very specific use case,
this has the benefit of a lot of tooling being available and large
companies putting a lot of resources into furthering Wasm development.

* <span class="highlight">Efficient JIT execution: </span>
64 and 32-bit integer operation support that maps one-to-one with CPU instructions.

* <span class="highlight">Minimalistic: </span> Formal spec that fits on a single page.

* <span class="highlight">Deterministic execution: </span>
Wasm is easily made deterministic by removing floating point operations, which is necessary for consensus algorithms.

* <span class="highlight">Open Standards > Custom Solutions: </span>
Wasm is a standard for web browsers developed by W3C workgroup that includes Google, Mozilla, and others.
There’s been many years of work put into Wasm, both by compiler and standardisation teams.

* <span class="highlight">Many languages available: </span> Wasm expands the family of languages available to smart contract developers to include Rust, C/C++, AssemblyScript, C#, Haxe, and Kotlin. This means you can write smart contracts in whichever language you’re familiar with.

* <span class="highlight">Memory-safe, sandboxed, and platform-independent.</span>

* <span class="highlight">LLVM support: </span>
Supported by the LLVM compiler infrastructure project, meaning that Wasm benefits from over a decade of LLVM’s compiler optimisation.

* <span class="highlight">Large companies involved: </span> Continually developed by major companies such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Facebook.
